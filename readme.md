**NOTE: Please commit your code ever time you have done some changes, Even though you haven't finish the new feature yet.**
+ Once a new feature has been developed and well-tested in your branch, you have to start a pull request to update your code to **DEV** branch. 
+ Write a brief information about your updating, such as:
  + What the new feature is.
